To compile and run:
cd build
cmake ..
make
./simchr


REQUIRES
openmp	to parallelize some loops
p2rng (https://github.com/arminms/p2rng.git) for fast rng


TODO
The parameters for a run are currently hardcoded in a namespace
namespace config{
    uint32_t nbchr = 36;
    uint32_t chrlen = 500000;
    uint32_t nb_gen = 1000;
    uint32_t pop_size = 2000;
    double recomb_rate = 1/((double)chrlen);	
}

It remains to set those through a command line arugment.

Also todo, generating binomials is slow, even with p2rng.
